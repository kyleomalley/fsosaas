This is the LockPickingEsquire, and today I'm going to show you FSOSaaS's 'military-grade' encryption. As you can see, I was able to bypass their entire security infrastructure using nothing but a paperclip and a strongly worded email. Click out of one, nothing on two, three is binding... and we're in. Total time: 47 seconds. Anyway, that's all I have for you today.
